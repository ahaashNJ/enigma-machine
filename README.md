# Introduction

Was bored and needed to refresh python knowledge, hence started to build the enigma machine.

Implemented a basic enigma machine with basic functionality which consist of defined 3/5 rotors and hardcoded plugboard values.

# Implementation

## User Interface

Below is the UI of the implemented enigma machine.

The path is observable from keyboard -> plugboard -> rotors -> reflector -> rotors -> plugboard -> lampboard

Only english alphabet characters are allowed as keystrokes. Any other character input will generate an error message.

# Improvements

Implement the UI so that 3/5 rotors can be selected in the begining.

Implement the UI so that upto 10 letter pairs can be entered as a user input to the plugboard.

Improve the UI.
